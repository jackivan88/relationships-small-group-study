# Hope in the Middle

My relationships will never be perfect. But because of Christ I can make it through the problems and I can be used by him as an instrument of grace. That means that I need to remain in Christ so that I can bear fruit in my relationships and I need to encourage others to remain in Christ. So why can relationships be so difficult, and how can you get through it?

## Relationships in the Middle

The problem with relationships is that they all take place right in the middle of something: God's plan to use everything in our lives to make us more like Christ. We never get to be married to a fully sanctified spouse. We will never be in a relationship with a completely mature friend. We will never have self-parenting children. We will never live next to a neighbor who has no need to grow and change. We will never be near people who always think, say, desire, or do the right things. And the reason for all of this is that our relationships take place in the present.

Everyone who lives in the present will experience four things. As we consider each of these areas, consider also the hope that we can have in response.

### Our relationships will never work according to our plans

Our relationships don't work according to our plans because they are part of *God's* plan. This often means that God will take us where we have not planned to go in order to produce in us what we could not achieve on our own. He will lead us through the hardships of relationships so that our hearts will be revealed, our character strengthened, and we will become more and more like him.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Even though our relationships will never work according to our plans, what is our hope in Christ? (God is completely in control, God has a plan for our good and his glory, God will not give us more than we can handle, and God is our shepherd and will guide us.)*

### Our relationships will never live up to our expectations

Our expectations often can follow closely from our dreams. And when it comes to relationships, we dream of unchallenged unity, unfettered romance, unobstructed communication, mutual cooperation, blanket acceptance and respect, shared decisions, intimate friendship, or an absence of conflict. Our expectations tend to forget that our relationships are being lived out in the middle of the already and the not yet. This side of eternity none of us gets to be with the person of our dreams, and none of us are ready to be the person of someone else's dream! At some point in every relationship, we are required to accept graciously who the other person is.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Even though our relationships will never live up to our expectations, what is the hope we have in Christ? (Even though people are flawed, Jesus isn't, Jesus is faithful and won't give up on us or the other person, and we can look forward to living in harmony in the kingdom of God.)*

### Our relationships will always have some kind of difficulty

Building relationships is like threading a needle while driving on a bumpy road! No relationship will be completely successful in avoiding the problems that are a normal part of life. Sometimes the difficulty will be the other person - pride, selfishness, greed, anger, bitterness, or impatience. Sometimes the difficulty will reflect the reality of a fallen world - racism, persecution, injury, disease, war, mechanical failures, or an imperfect government, culture, and economy.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Even though our relationships will always have some kind of difficulty, what is the hope we have in Christ? (Even problems are sent and used by God to help us become more mature [James 1], God is always there to help during problems, we can pray to him any time, and Jesus is advocating for us.)*

### Our relationships will always need to improve

No matter how good even the best relationship is, room for improvement exists. Because we have not yet escaped our sin, our relationships will require difficult work and continued growth.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Even though our relationships will always need to improve, what is the hope we have in Christ? (God gives us the grace and strength to do his will, and the fruit of the Spirit can increase as we walk with Christ [John 15].)*

## The Hardship of Relationships in the Middle

The hardships of relationships are not only that they don't ever meet our expectations or follow our plans, or that they can just be difficult. The hardship includes the fact that God calls each of us to minister to the people he has placed in our lives in the midst of the difficulties. We are not called to only survive and bear with the weaknesses of others but to actually be used as instruments of grace in their lives. This requires humility to live with a sinner in a world of difficulty, gentleness to be a part of what God is doing in someone's life and not get in the way, patience to deal with the sin and weakness of those around you, perseverance to not give up, forgiveness, and forbearance to respond in love even when you are provoked.

*How do you feel about being called to be an instrument of change in another person's life?*

## Encouraging Others in the Middle

Life in the middle of something is difficult. Therefore, the skill and practice of encouragement is essential for a biblically healthy community. It is rare when encouragement is not appropriate, but even when we want to encourage someone, our encouragement can fall short. We tend to make two mistakes. First, we tend to think encouragement is primarily about making the other person feel better.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Can you think of some things we say that focus on making the other person feel better?*

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *What can be wrong with this focus? (Such statements are not always true; they often provide only temporary comfort; they produce a temporary change of mood that melts away once the person faces the difficulty again.)*

We also try to encourage the person by explaining what the problem is and why it is happening. We think that if the person understands what is going on, he will be less anxious and more able to do things that are helpful and constructive. There are occasions where this is true and when it is important to gain insight and understanding, but explanation does not always comfort. Sometimes the more accurate our understanding the more discouraged we become - once we had a superficial understanding, but now we know how deep the problem is and we are more overwhelmed than ever. Encouragement must go deeper than providing understanding.

Real encouragement is more about sight than it is about explanation. Not seeing with our physical eyes but with the eyes of our heart. Spiritual sightedness is about seeing unseen spiritual realities. The reason we get overwhelmed and discouraged in relationships is not because we don't understand what is going on. We are discouraged because we don't see Christ. When the eyes of our heart don't focus on Christ, we end up focusing on the immediate difficulties. We see the husband who barely communicates. We see the friend who has been disloyal. We see the child who rebels against every command. We see the boss who is unrelentingly critical. We see the relative who breaks every promise she ever makes. We see the wife who is bitter and angry. We see neighbors who are more concerned about boundaries than community. And the one thing that can give us the hope and courage to go on becomes obstructed by the looming problems. That one thing is Christ.

As we live with one another in the middle, we need more than good feelings and accurate understanding. We need eyes to see this one amazing reality: that we are Christ's and he is ours. This is the encouragement we all need to hear and refocused upon. We need to help others see three things so that they do not give up and lose hope in the middle of relational difficulties.

#### Christ's Presence

Your goal here is to help others develop a "Christ is with me" mentality. A good passage to refer to is Psalm 46:1-2:

> God is our refuge and strength,  
a very present help in trouble.  
Therefore we will not fear though the earth gives way,  
though the mountains be moved into the heart of the sea,  

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *What is the image of difficulty the psalmist creates?*

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *What is the response the psalmist says we will have? Why?*

Even when terrible things are happening, we can have peace because we know our powerful and glorious God is with us. Our hope does not rest on the shoulders of our own strength, wisdom, and character but on his. God is here and able to do what we could never do.

#### Christ's Promises

Though people may react negatively to hearing how Christ's promises speak to their situation - seeing them as spiritual trickery to make them feel good about something that is bothering them - those promises are the true identity of the believer. Christ's promises are not mystical, cuddly unrealities but accurate assessments of the true resources we have as God's children.

#### Our Potential in Christ

When we struggle, we often begin to measure our potential. We assess ourselves to see whether we have what it takes to get through the difficulty. The problem is that most of us are poor personal accountants. When we add up the things that define our potential, we leave out the most important asset: Christ. Galatians 2:20 says:

> I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *How does this verse help us accurately view our potential? (Our potential is Christ living in us, and he wants to help; our potential is not our wisdom, strength, or ability but our faith.)*

## Closing Activity

Thinking about a relationship you have, answer the following questions:

1. *Has the relationship gone according to your plan?*
2. *Is the relationship living up to your expectation?*
3. *What problems is your relationship facing?*
4. *What's one improvement you could make in the relationship?*
5. *What from this lesson has encouraged you or given you hope?*

## Central Point

1. We are all in the middle of being redeemed and perfected.
2. My relationships will never be perfect.
3. God not only wants us to endure the process of redemption and perfection but to use us in the lives of others as a part of the process.

## Personal Application

1. I can't expect my relationships to go according to my plan, expectations, or will.
2. I can have hope because of Christ's promises, presence, and potential.
3. I can be used by God in his work of redemption.

## Relational Application

1. I need to be patient, humble, forbearing, gentle, and loving in my response to others because none of us is perfect (yet).
2. I can give hope to others by encouraging them to focus on Christ's promises, presence, and potential.
