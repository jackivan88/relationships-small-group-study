title: Relationships and the Nature of God
---

God is a community and created us to live in community so that we may be a reflection of him. I need to be properly involved in relationships, and I can only have satisfying relationships with others if I am in a right relationship with God. Therefore, Do I see and treat relationships as God intends for me to?

## Isolation vs. Immersion

Relationships will be hard. Having to deal with flawed people in a broken world can make one wonder if they're even worth it. Have you felt this way? Have you avoided another student so you don't have to deal with a problem? Have you avoided saying how you feel because it doesn't seem like it would be worth it to tell them?

Because relationships are so hard, it can lead to families sharing homes without talking. Going to church without sharing in the lives of others. Neighbors living next to each other for years without knowing anything about each other. Is this a valid way to live? Is it OK to keep to ourselves to avoid hurt?

We can live with a tension between our desire for meaningful relationships and self-preservation. We can avoid many of the mistakes common to relationships without avoiding relationships. Every relational decision we make moves us toward isolation or immersion. Sometimes we will find ourselves at an extreme of this continuum. The temptation is either to make more or less of relationships than God intended.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Which end of the continuum you tend to move toward and why?*

Our relationships tend to fit one of these three profiles:

### The Frustrated Relationship

In this relationship, one person moves toward isolation and the other moves toward immersion. One dreams of being safe; the other dreams of being close and intimate.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *How would the perfect vacation look to each of the two people in this relationship?*

The one who seeks isolation may just want to sit and read. The one seeking immersion may want lots of activities to do together.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *How might it feel to live in this type of relationship?*

The isolationist can feel smothered while the immersionist feels rejected. Both feel like their expectations are unmet. Both feel frustrated and disappointed, which may lead to anger between them.

### The Enmeshed Relationship

Here both people move toward immersion. Both parties are dependent on the other.

*How would the perfect vacation look to each of the two people in this relationship?*

They might spend every moment together, to the neglect of all other relationships. Or, they may spend all their time with others because they crave relationships so much.

*How might it feel to live in this type of relationship?*

Because they depend so much on each other, unmet expectations lead to hurt feelings. This can lead them to be critical of the other. Because they feel like they can never meet the others expectations they become discouraged. People in these relationships exhaust themselves dealing with minor problems and offenses. They may also spend too much time with other people, or offend the other person if they want to take time alone.

### The Isolated Relationship

In this relationship both persons tend toward isolation. Both make relational decisions based on maintaining safety.

*How would the perfect vacation look to each of the two people in this relationship?*

They might enjoy spending the time alone, reading different books.

*How might it feel to live in this type of relationship?*

The relationship feels empty and disappointing because they both want to be safe. But they're both also wired to want connections with other people. So neither one is completely happy.

## Our Communal God (20 minutes)

God made us in his image. So we cannot talk about human relationships without thinking about the nature of God.

> **John 17:20-26** “I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their word, that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me. The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and loved them even as you loved me. Father, I desire that they also, whom you have given me, may be with me where I am, to see my glory that you have given me because you loved me before the foundation of the world. O righteous Father, even though the world does not know you, I know you, and these know that you have sent me. I made known to them your name, and I will continue to make it known, that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.”

*For whom and for what is Jesus praying in this part of his prayer?*

He is praying for all who will believe in him, and he prays for their unity - that they would be one. Jesus is looking back on his ministry and all it accomplished. He's looking forward to the cross and what it will produce. And his focus is on community. Of all the things Christ could pray for at this moment, he prays for the unity of his people.

*What is the model for community Jesus sees for his people?*

Jesus want us to have the same community with God and with others that he has with the Father and Spirit. We can see this community also in Genesis 1:26, where God speaks in the plural. God knows how to help us in our struggles with community because he *is* a community. We tend to think of God as an individual. While God is one, the Bible also says he exists in three persons: the trinity. God is a model of loving, cooperative, unified community where diversity is an asset.

*If God himself is a community, what does it mean to be human, made in God's likeness?*

We're meant to be in community; we're meant to be social beings. In Genesis 2:18 as God looks at his creation before the fall, he says "It is not good for man to be alone." Community with one another is not only a duty; it is an aspect of our humanity.

*In Christ's prayer, what is one of the purposes for human community?*

Human community should reflect God's glory to the world so they will believe in God the Father and God the Son. God has a purpose for relationships, so our relationships must reflect God's intentions.

*Why do we need Christ to be praying for us?*

We are sinners; we can't manufacture true community on our own. Sin's self-centeredness cuts us off from God and others.

*Christ not only prays for our unity with one another but that we would also have community with whom?*

Jesus prays that we would have community with God and invites us to be a part of this divine community! And it is out of this community that we can experience community with one another. In fact, we can't move toward community with one another until we are in community with God.

*What else about this prayer shows God's deep commitment to creating true community?*

1. It's possible that Jesus is referring to the Holy Spirit as the glory he has given us. If so, it means God has empowered us, in spite of the ongoing presence of sin, to have meaningful relationships. The Spirit who allowed Christ to minister is the same Spirit dwelling in us to allow us to minister.
2. Christ faced death on a cross to restore our relationship to God and so that our relationships with others can glorify God.

## Conclusion (5 minutes)

*Think about the stages of a person's life beginning from birth. What can you identify that shows we need community with others?*

* We are dependent on someone else from the moment we are born
* We seek out human relationships
* As teens we seek the acceptance of our peers
* As young adults we seek deeper, more committed relationships
* We have a web of communities we function in: church, neighborhood, schools, family, and work
* Our fondest memories and deepest hurts often involve relationships
* We grieve at the loss of a loved one, even when we know they are with the Lord

*Are there any relationships in your life you need to correct your perspective on?*

God designed us to be relational. It is our nature, and it is one way in which we reflect the image of God. And *only* when we live in community do we reflect the likeness of God. Relationships are not optional! Because of sin, relationships can be messy, but they are not optional.

Problems in relationships are often rooted in our selfish desires. We seek to fulfill our own perceived wants and needs instead of seeking to please God. If there are problems in your relationships, the solution starts with God. The circle of human community is only healthy when it exists within community with God.
