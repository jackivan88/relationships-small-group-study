# Relationships Small Group Study

These are the course materials for the *Relationships: A Mess Worth Making* small group study at Seoul Christian School. They're meant to be read through at least once by the study leader, and then either worked through verbatim with their group or adapted as the leader sees fit. Each lesson should take about fifty minutes depending on the amount of discussion that takes place. Wherever a discussion question is placed, the group leader should take time to stop, ask the question, and allow participants to answer. Participants shouldn't be forced to answer, but the more people discuss, the better the study will be. Where applicable I have included possible answers or prompts to those questions if participants are having a hard time breaking the ice.

You should explain to your group that you're not specifically dealing with romantic relationships, but relationships in general. Although dating or marriage relationships are important, we need to work on all of our relationships.
