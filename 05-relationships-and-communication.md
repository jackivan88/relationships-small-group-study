Lesson 05: Relationships and Communication

## Review

*Share verses that describe our identity in Christ.*

*What is the problem in any relationship?*

*What are the two foundation stones upon which healthy relationships are built?*

1. Proper identity: who I am in Christ.
2. Proper worship: viewing Christ as he is.

## Central Point and Application

*Central Point:* As Christ's ambassadors, we represent him every time we speak.

*Personal Application:* I need to seek God's grace in how I communicate with others and choose to be his ambassador.

*Relational Application:* As Christ's ambassador, I need to speak in a way that is helpful to those God has placed me in relationship with.

Will you choose to speak as an ambassador of Christ?

## A Radical Commitment to the Call of Christ

Read 2 Corinthians 5:20

*What job description does Paul assign to us?*

Ambassadors.

*How is that job description significant in our relationship with God?*

We are God's representatives here on earth. It focuses on God's rule as King.

*How is it significant in our communication with others?*

As God's representatives, we speak on his behalf.

As ambassadors, we do one thing - represent Christ. As ambassadors, it is our job to incarnate a king who is not present. The king's interests will direct every word we speak. Therefore, as ambassadors, what we say must be driven by what God is seeking to accomplish in us and in other people.

*According to 2 Corinthians 5:20, what is God trying to accomplish?*

Reconciliation.

God is working in every situation and in every relationship to reclaim our wandering hearts, and he calls us to speak in a way that has this reconciliation in view. Unfortunately we lose sight of reconciliation in many ways: When we flatter friends because we want them to like us. When we trim the truth to avoid a conflict. When we yell at our children about their messy rooms. When winning arguments is all we care about. When we indulge in gossip. When we are better at pointing out wrong than asking for forgiveness. When we use words to hurt others rather than help them. When our communication stays resolutely impersonal. When our words make us the center of attention.

Here is the point: our words are always in pursuit of some kind of kingdom. We are either speaking as mini-kings, seeking to establish our will in our relationships and circumstances, or we are speaking as ambassadors, seeking to be part of what the King is doing. And when two mini-kings talk to each other, the battle of words has no end! When our words reflect the self-focused desires of our hearts rather than God's work of reconciliation, our struggle has no end. When we use worlds to establish our will rather than submit to God's, we plunge into difficulty. If we are ever to be helped, this is where we must start.

The vast majority of our communication takes place in the inconsequential moments of everyday life. As a result, we can view communication as ordinary and insignificant. The moments are rare when what we say will literally be life changing. However, the course of our lives is set by the ways we respond to the little moments. The character developed in a thousand little moments is what we carry into the big, important moments.

For instance, every day, we tell people what we thing of them, what we want from them, and what we would like to enjoy from them. But we don't do this in grand moments of oratory. We do it in quick side comments in the bedroom as we get ready for work or at the curb as we hop into the car or in the kitchen as we grab a sandwich or over dessert at the local bistro or in the family room during a commercial. It is these moments of everyday conversation that influence the shape, quality, and direction of our relationships. Every day, our words give our relationships their tone.

There has never been a good relationship without good communication, and there has never been a bad relationship that didn't get that way in part because of something that was said (or not said). The Bible has much to say about our world of talk. The Bible does not consider this area of life ordinary or unimportant. In fact, it does the opposite. It assigns words the extraordinary value they actually deserve.

## God's Perspective on Our Words

### Our Words Have Power

Read Proverbs 18:21

*How can words kill?*

Words can kill a spirit, a dream, kill an attitude or perspective. Killing words are angry, hurtful, slanderous, selfish, bitter, divisive, and demeaning forms of talk.

*How can words give life?*

They can give life to a spirit or a dream; they can give birth to an attitude or perspective. Life-giving words encourage, comfort, make peace, build up, unify, and show love and gratitude.

Our words always have direction. They can either be constructive or destructive. Words have power. Think about your communication in the last week. Has it been more destructive or constructive? Think about a conflict you had with someone. Did you direct your words to be life giving or deadly?

### Our Words Belong to the Lord

Genesis 1 makes clear God spoke the first works ever spoken. Language is not a human invention and therefore belongs to God. Language is his creation. Words are a gift calling us to live and speak in a God-focused manner. One of our greatest mistakes in communication is to take words as our own to use as we please. This is what a teenager does as he publicly mocks a friend. This is what a husband does when he criticizes his wife at dinner. This is what friends do as they gossip on the phone. This is what the demanding, critical parent does. They are all stealing God's glory by treating words as their own creation.

### The World of Talk Is a World of Trouble

If you are honest, you have to admit that your relationships have been troubled by words as much as they have been helped. Who can honestly say that all his words are well intentioned and appropriately spoken? Who has not hurt someone with words or used words in a selfish manner? Who has not turned the gift of language into a weapon of anger? James 3:2b says:

> If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.

*What does James indicate about our words?*

We will never be perfect in our speech; our words are an indicator of our spiritual maturity; our words reveal our need for God's grace.

### Word Problems Are Heart Problems

Read Luke 6:45

*According to Jesus, where do our words come from?*

Our hearts.

*What then is the real problem, when our words create conflict?*

The condition of our heart is the problem. Our problem with words is not primarily a matter of vocabulary, skill, or timing; it is always the attitude, thoughts, desires, emotions, and purposes that dwell within us.

Have you ever said, "Oops! I didn't mean to say that"? Often it would be more accurate to say, "I'm sorry I said what I meant"! The real problem with our communication is *what we want to say* and *why we want to say it.* The problem actually begins before the words are even spoken. Christ says the heart shapes the *what* and the *why*. Therefore, if we hope to transform the way we talk to one another, the heart must change first.

## Talking Like an Ambassador

What does it mean to communicate like an ambassador? Does it mean that we quote Scripture incessantly or constantly point out the sin in others? Does it mean we can never talk about sports or the weather? What about the daily need to discuss the details of life - schedules, responsibilities, problems, and plans - with people?

Read Ephesians 4:29-30

Here is a practical model of ambassadorial communication. Speaking as an ambassador is not about using biblical words; it's about speaking with a biblical agenda.

### Speaking with a Biblical Agenda

#### Consider the Person

> ...to the use of edifying...

Wholesome communication is others-centered. When our words are shaped more by our interests than others', they lose their shelter from difficulty. Paul says we should never say anything that is not helpful for others. Because God is focused on remaking us into his image, we should speak in a way that builds people up as well. We are his ambassadors. We now have a redemptive agenda for talking about everything. We want all of our talk to be redemptively constructive, from the most mundane details to the huge life decisions. As ambassadors, we never want our words to be obstacles to what the King is doing. Our words must always be others-centered.

#### Consider the Problem

> Give to him that needeth...

Ambassadors who are always centered on others also must always be asking, "What is the problem at this moment?" Before we speak we must think about what *others* are struggling with and what *others* most need. Do they need encouragement, comfort, hope, direction, wisdom, courage, rebuke, warning, forgiveness, patience, teaching, correction, thanks, a job description, or something else? Our words are shaped by their needs. An ambassador's words always address the person's true need of the moment.

#### Consider the Process

> ...minister grace unto the hearers...

This means that we focus on the best way to say what needs to be said. Ambassadorial communication is not only about the content of our words but the manner in which they are spoken. Often we choose to say the right thing at the wrong time or in the wrong way. But the communication process needs to benefit the person as much as the content of the words. Confronting a teenager five minutes before she leaves for school is not helpful, even if the content is accurate. Rebuking a friend for an offense in front of others is not helpful. Asking your spouse to consider how much they hurt you as they are trying to get to sleep is not helpful. An ambassador seeks to speak the right thing in the best way.

Will you be Christ's ambassador to those he places you in relationship with? Our relationships have been designed as workrooms for redemption, not shelters for human happiness. Paul's practical model to guide our words ends with something very interesting: "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit." Not only to our self-centered, unhelpful, and untimely words hurt and grieve other people, they also grieve the Lord.

### Central Point

1. Words are significant.
2. Our words belong to God.
3. The problem we have with words is really a problem we have in our heart.

### Personal Application

1. If I want God's will in my relationships, I need to seriously consider the words I use and how I speak them.
2. I need to submit my will to God's so that the words that overflow from my heart are not self-seeking.
3. I need to take seriously my role as Christ's ambassador and represent him in what I say.

### Relational Application

1. I need to see my relationships as opportunities for God to use me in the life of another as his ambassador.
2. I need to consider the other person's interests when I speak.
3. I need to consider what the other person is struggling with when I speak.
4. I need to consider the best way to say the right thing.
