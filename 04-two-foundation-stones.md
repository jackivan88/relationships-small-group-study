# Two Foundation Stones

Good relationships build on remembering who we are in God's eyes and worshiping God for who he is. I love and serve others best when I remember all I am in Christ and when I allow God to be Creator, Sovereign, and Savior. I need to accept and appreciate others as they are and not take God's role in changing them or in finding my identity in them. So, how are your relationships affected by how you see yourself and how you see God?

Hard work will not make your relationships what God intends them to be without a solid foundation. We have talked about why relationships are so difficult and time consuming. But what are the foundations of a healthy, God-honoring relationship? What are the daily thoughts, desires, and habits that make relationships good? Why do we struggle with one person one way and with another a different way?

Consider Matt and Rob. Matt and Rob both get along well with others and have good relationships with their wives. But, Matt and Rob's business venture was now filled with conflict. When Matt suggested using their resources for the community, Rob saw it as bad business. Matt, wanting Rob's respect and acceptance, became bitter.

When Rob made even the smallest decision without Matt, Matt became irrational and angry. As a result they struggled to make decisions. They wanted the partnership to work and tried hard to work through the issues as they felt God wanted them to. But they never seemed to get past the disagreements and hurts. Their partnership felt like a never-ending battle.

## The Two Foundation Stones

We can think that our relationships are difficult because we lack skill and experience. Since we're inexperienced, we make mistakes. This may be true in part, but the greater problem is the foundation we are walking on. This foundation is not what we do or say. It begins in the heart. Remember that our greatest problem is inside of us! If our heart's foundation is God's truth, design, and purpose then our relationships are on solid ground. Good relationships are always built on the foundation stones of *identity* and *worship*.

When we talk about identity, we are talking about how we define ourselves. Our talents, qualities, experiences, achievements, goals, beliefs, relationships, and dreams. We use these to say, "This is who I am." When we talk about worship, we are talking about the things we live for. The desires, goals, treasures, purposes, values, or cravings that control our hearts. God wants and deserves to be the center of our identity and worship. These issues of identity and worship are an important part of our nature as human beings. What we believe and do about these two things will shape the way we live with the people God has placed in our lives. When we have a biblical sense of who we are (identity) and who God is (worship), we can build healthy relationships.

### Remembering Who You Are

We all try to make sense out of life by telling ourselves who we are. We all have an "I am ______, so I can ______" way of living. The identity we assign ourselves will always affect the way we respond to others. For example, if I tell myself that I am smarter than you, it will be difficult for me to listen when you give advice. If I tell myself that I deserve your respect, I will watch to see if you are giving me what I think I deserve.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *What identities had Matt and Rob built their relationship on? (Rob seems to be getting his identity from success and achievement but feels as if Matt is in his way; Matt seems to be resting his identity on gaining respect and acceptance from Rob, but feels as if Rob doesn't need or appreciate him)*

The Bible provides examples of people who forgot their identities and their wrong reactions. The Bible also presents people who remembered their true identities and their proper reactions. See if you can identify the true identity each person forgot, the false identity that replaced it, and the result of the false identity. Let me give an example before we begin:

*Example: Adam and Eve eating from the forbidden tree*

1. Their true identity was to be dependent on God, living within the boundaries he set for them.
2. They made themselves independent of God and deserving of more than God gave them.
3. The reaction was to disobey God, resulting in sin and separation from God.

*Abraham and Sarah having a surrogate son*

1. Their true identity was as chosen children of God and inheritors of his promise.
2. They made themselves the fulfiller of the promise.
3. The reaction was to take control and resulted in conflict and hostility.

*Peter separating himself from the Gentiles*

1. His true identity was a sinner saved by grace through faith; he was God's messenger for all nations.
2. He instead made himself a slave to the law again and dependent on the judgments of others.
3. As a result there was conflict and rejection of the Gentile brothers.

Now, let's see if we can identify the true identity each of these people remembered and the result:

*Moses leading people out of Egypt*

1. He remembered he was God's instrument.
2. He was able to lead the people out of Egypt into the Promised Land.

*David facing Goliath*

1. He remembered he was God's servant and that God was on his side.
2. He was able to face Goliath and defeat him.

*Paul and Silas in prison*

1. They remembered they were in God's hands - loved and seen by him at all times.
2. They were able to sing hymns as they sat in prison.

Who we tell ourselves we are has quite a powerful impact on the way we deal with the big and small issues of daily life. Where we find our identity affects how we respond to the difficult work of relationships. We can get our identity out of who God is and who he has made us in Christ. Or we can find our identity in our circumstances, relationships, and successes. A lot of the disappointment we experience is the result of finding our identity in others. We try to get from relationships what we already have in Christ.

No human being was ever meant to be the source of personal joy and contentment for someone else. No sinner is going to be able to provide that day after day in a close relationship like marriage! Our spouse, our friends, and our children cannot be the sources of our identity. If we seek our identity from others, we will watch, listen, and depend on them in ways they can't handle. We will ride the roller coaster of their best and worst moments. We will become frustrated with their weaknesses and failures. We will become critical, disappointed, hopeless, and angry because they fail to provide the identity we want. As a result, we will have damaged relationships filled with hurt, frustration, and anger. Remember that Christ has given us everything we need to be the people he has designed us to be. That frees us to serve and love others. We are free to be humble, patient, gentle, and forbearing.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Is there evidence that you are looking to your relationships to give you things you have in Christ? What symptoms can you identify (anger, frustration, fear, disappointment, hurt, hopelessness, etc)?*

### Remembering Who God Is

Just as we all look for our identity, we are also all worshipers. But we are not talking about worship as a formal religious activity, but rather as an identity. What controls our hearts? Our hearts are always under the control of something. Whatever controls our hearts controls our behavior. What does Jesus say about worship in Matthew 6:19-24?

> “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.
>
> “The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!
>
> “No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.

Jesus says what we worship (our treasure) is what will control us (where our hearts will be). We cannot serve two masters - we will serve what we value most. This has an interesting application for relationships. When we value something other than pleasing God, we end up valuing and serving ourselves. When we value God, we will serve and love others. There are three basic ways that our worship of God affects our relationships with others.

#### Worshiping God as Creator

Psalm 139:13-16 has a lot to say about who we are and who God is:

> For you formed my inward parts;  
> you knitted me together in my mother's womb.  
> I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.  
> Wonderful are your works;  
> my soul knows it very well.  
> My frame was not hidden from you,
> when I was being made in secret,  
> intricately woven in the depths of the earth.  
> Your eyes saw my unformed substance;  
> in your book were written, every one of them,  
> the days that were formed for me,  
> when as yet there was none of them.

If you have been fearfully and wonderfully made, what does that mean in how you see and treat others? They are not a mistake in any way. The shape of their bodies, the sound of their voices, their personalities, and their abilities are all designed by God. A glorious, wise Creator made them just the way they are.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *If you worship God as the Creator, what is your role in trying to change others? (My role is only to love and appreciate the creation and point them in the direction of the one who can change them)*

We say that God is the Creator of all things. It's easy to worship him as Creator on Sunday and then curse his work during the week. Dissatisfaction with the way God has made the people we relate to each day is just like cursing his work. In fact, we often sit on his throne and try to recreate others in our *own* image!

Have you ever tried to make someone just like you? Without realizing it, that is what Matt and Rob were doing to each other. Rob was a visionary who was trying to turn his detail-oriented partner into a dreamer. Matt was an administrator who was trying to recreate Rob into his own image. If you are not affirming God's glory in the way he made others, it will frustrate you. You won't be happy with who the other person is and you'll try to remake them in some way. If I am ever going to value who you are and enjoy our differences, I must look at you and see the wisdom of the Creator.

#### Worshipping God as Sovereign

Acts 17:26 shows us another aspect of God:

> And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place....

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *If it is God who has determined our backgrounds, how should we see and treat the differences between us? (We need to respect and appreciate those differences)*

God has determined the details of each of our lives. When I look at you I need to see God writing your story. God's sovereign choices and your responses to the story he has written for you have shaped who you are.

He determined that you would be part of the customs and culture of a certain ethnic group. He planned that you would live in a certain geographical setting. He determined that you would live in a particular family. A family with influential values and rules, spoken and unspoken.

He determined that you would be in relationships and situations that would influence everything you do. A relationship is the intersection of the stories of two people. The problem is that an awful lot of problems happen at this intersection. If I fail to honor God's sovereign influences in your life and the way those influences have shaped you, I will try to take God's place and change you into my image. I will tend to think my way is better than your way.

Are you frustrated with someone in your life? Are you trying to reshape that person to fit into your personal preferences?

#### Worshiping God as Savior

Though God has made us all unique, we are exactly the same in two ways according to Romans 3:21-25a:

> But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it— the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *According to this passage what are the two ways we are the same? (We are all sinners, and we are all saved through faith in Jesus Christ)*

Worshiping God as Savior means that we acknowledge that we are sinners. We are sinners in relationships with other sinners. We remember that we are all still in the middle of God's work of redemption. He is working with others at the best time and in the best way possible. None of us gets to be in relationships with finished people. When we forget that we are sinners saved by grace, we become self-righteous, impatient, critical, and judgmental. We give in to the temptation to play God and try to change others in ways only God can.

When we fail to worship God as Savior, we are too casual about our sin and too focused on others'. When we try to justify our own sins while condemning others' our relationships suffer. The weaknesses and failures of others affect us when they sin against us. We need to allow God to use us as tools in his hands rather than seek to make changes in other people whom only God can change.

Are you trying to do work in someone's life that only the Savior can do?

## Central Point

1. Good relationships build on a true identity and true worship.
2. I am free to love and serve others when I focus on what I have in Christ (identity).
3. I can best accept and appreciate others when I worship God as Creator, Sovereign, and Savior.

## Personal Application

1. I need to examine where I get my identity.
2. I have everything I need in Christ.
3. I need to examine what my treasure is.
4. I need to let God be God and not try to do his work.

## Relational Application

1. I need to stop looking for what I think I need from others.
2. I need to give people time to change and accept and appreciate them as God's workmanship.
3. I need to accept that God is in control of who people are and allow *him* to work as he sees best.
