# Conflict

Relationships bring conflict but also growth. I need to face conflict and be willing to identify the selfish desires of my heart that lead to conflict. I need to commit to working through conflict for the good of the relationship. I must be willing to accept and confess my sin, and consider the needs of the other person. What are the sinful desires that lead to conflict?

For the better part of five years, Ashley and Hannah had worked side by side in campus ministry. They loved what they did, and they loved doing it together. But Hannah had been seeking to undermine Ashley's relationship with the students. She wanted others to see her as the one who was more capable and in charge. She wanted to students to like and admire her more than Ashley. Now Ashley felt things had gotten out of control. Once again her friend had just hurt her, so she made an appointment to meet with Hannah to speak her mind.

Ashley began the meeting accusing Hannah of talking about her to some students. "I can't believe you talk that way behind my back! I have never done that to you, and I never would." Ashley's hurt had boiled over into anger and accusation.

Hannah denied everything. "I can't believe you would accuse me of saying those things to other people. I thought our friendship was stronger than that. How come you have held this in for five years? Why didn't you just come to me earlier?"

As the two talked, the origin of the problem began to emerge. Hannah had said how "task-oriented" Ashley could be to someone who didn't like Ashley. She said it was a real pain sometimes to live with her. This remark took on a life of its own when the person repeated it to others with her own embellishments. The word found its way back to Ashley. By then it sounded as if Hannah saw her friend as a task-oriented demon. It seemed like she just used people to accomplish her ministry goals.

It's inevitable. If we live with other sinners, we will have conflict. The closer we are to others, the more potential there is for conflict.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *What do you think is the root of Ashley and Hannah's problem?*

Though Hannah's words were subtle, they were the overflow of her heart. She calculated them to make Ashley look bad. The desire to look better than Ashley was already in Hannah's heart before she spoke the words. Hannah did not see Ashley's temperament as God's sovereign design but as sin. Hannah did not extend grace to Ashley as God would want her to do, and she did not speak out of Ashley's best interest. Ashley did not look to be Christ's ambassador to Hannah and speak in the best manner. Instead of looking for God's  power, Ashley took on the role of judge and accuser. Ashley did not move toward the relationship as Christ's ambassador. Instead, she distanced herself and her feelings from Hannah.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *What do you think will restore the relationship?*

## Facing Conflicts Head On

Relationships are costly but so is avoiding them. If we choose to avoid relationships and the conflicts that arise, we will minimize the conflict in our lives, but we will also miss out on God's redemptive work in our lives.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Do you tend to avoid conflict or rush into it?*

**DISCSUSSION QUESTION:** *Do you move into conflict with a God-centered perspective?*

Remember, Jesus' death tore apart the Father, Son, and Spirit so that we might love one another. God wants to make us more like Christ, and he wants to use others to make that happen. We must be willing to face conflict and deal with it in a God-centered way.

### The Cause and Cure of Ungodly Conflict

Why can't one relationship in our lives come with a "no conflict" label attached to it? Some people think that is what marriage or dating is for, and these people are in for a surprise! In reality, marriage is the most likely place for conflict. Close relationships such as marriage are also the most likely places for supernatural change.

If we have a problem, conflict is a good one to have. Why? Because conflict is a problem the Bible addresses. We don't have to be expert Bible scholars to get help here. All we need is a heart that is ready and willing to hear the answer. Part of that answer is in James 4:1-10:

> What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *According to this passage in James, why do we fight with one another? (Our own desires; not getting what we want)*

James says the root of human conflict is within *us*. Often our typical response to conflict is to point the finger at the other person. We say things such as, "I did that because you..." or "I wouldn't be so angry if you wouldn't...." We like to justify our response. After all, the other person has done something annoying, frustrating, or even downright sinful. But James is clear; conflict arises from the desires that battle within us. The word *desire* that James uses here is a word that would be better translated as "selfish desire." All desires are not wrong, but selfish desires are.

Think of a recent conflict you had with someone. Identify the desire in your heart that led to the conflict by taking a look at the desires below. They are not sinful until they become selfish desires. Fear often reveals them, because often what we fear is not getting what we want. Do you identify with any of these temptations? Were one of these desires in your heart during your last conflict?

- Comfort: I want, need, and deserve to be comfortable, and you'd better not get in the way of me getting it! I fear hard work and sacrifice.
- Pleasure: I want, need, and deserve to feel good, and you'd better make me feel that way! I fear pain.
- Recognition: I want, need, and deserve to be recognized, or I will be devastated. I fear being overlooked or unnoticed.
- Power: I want, need, and deserve power, and you'd better do what I say! I fear being told what to do.
- Control: I want, need, and deserve control, and you will feel the brunt of my disappointment if you mess up my tidy little universe! I fear unpredictability and the unknown.
- Acceptance: I want, need, and deserve acceptance, and you are responsible for giving it to me. I fear rejection.

Which of these desires has become more important to you than you relationship to God?

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Which of these desires most often leads to conflict in your life?*

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *In James 4:4, what does it mean to be a "friend of the world"? (To make yourself and your selfish desires more important than God's glory)*

Ashley and Hannah made recognition and reputation more important than God's glory and grace. They made a piece of creation their best friend and primary focus.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Do you find anything encouraging in James 4:4? (We can only be adulterous because we are married to God; he loves us as in a marriage relationship; we are also considered God's friends; though God is absolutely holy, he still loves us as his bride and accepts us as his friends)*

The next time you experience ungodly irritation with a friend, spouse, coworker, or child, ask yourself, "What is more important to me right now than God's glory?"

## What Does God Do to People Who Forsake Him for Something Else?

Consider a married couple where one partner has an affair. This person has betrayed the one to whom he or she is to be most committed. What would you expect the offended spouse to do? Would you expect that person to act as if nothing had happened? What if the offended spouse said, "Oh, that's okay"? Wouldn't you wonder whether that person cared about the relationship? If the offended person cared, you would expect to see some jealousy and anger over infidelity.

So it is with God in James 4:5-6.

> Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”

When we wander from God, the Spirit he has poured out on us and who now lives in us becomes quite concerned and envious. A better way to translate the words *envious* or *jealous* is the word *zealous.* Like the person whose spouse is unfaithful, God will do whatever it takes to regain our affection. He doesn't do this because he needs us; he does this because he loves us. When he pursues us and we humble ourselves and return to him, he pours out even more grace!

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *Based on what we have learned so far in this class, what do you think God uses to regain our affections? (Other people!)*

God uses the difficulties in relationships to allow us to see what we typically live for besides him. God used Ashley and Hannah in each other's lives to help them grow in repentance and faith.

Who is God using in your life right now? Do you see that your wise, sovereign, and gracious Redeemer was acting on your behalf when he placed this person in your life? If so, you are growing in your ability to engage in conflict in godly ways. Remember, you can't avoid conflict, but it can be a place where amazing growth takes place!

## Once We Are Rescued, What Should We Do?

James 4:7-10 says:

> Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.

Seeing God's redeeming love should lead us to grow in the joy of daily repentance and faith. Seeing, admitting, confessing, and forsaking sin (repentance) in combination with seeing, acknowledging, and adoring Christ (faith) is the only dynamic that can change a war-maker into a peacemaker. We are called upon to resist Satan's schemes to use parts of creation to entice our still-sinful hearts. We are commanded to humble ourselves and submit ourselves to God. Through humility and crying out to God for help, our hearts will be changed and purified, and our behavior will change as well.

## Let's Get Practical

To apply what James 4 teaches we have to begin with relationships built on commitment and love. Within those relationships we can start to form habits that can be practiced later on in tougher moments of conflict. What then does it look like to engage in godly conflict in the heat of the moment?

*Understand that conflict is one way God works in our lives.* In fact, God himself entered into conflict when he humbly came as a man to fight on our behalf against the ravages of sin. He calls us to imitate him as we engage in conflict with others. Godly conflict is an act of compassion.

*Identify what drives ungodly conflict in our lives.* What tends to lure our loyalty and affection away from God? Be specific and don't be surprised if each instance of ungodly conflict reveals a different idol, whether it be acceptance, power, control, recognition, pleasure, or being right.

*Recognize our default strategy in conflict.* Most of us have a default strategy we use to get what we want. Do we love to fight because we have to be right? Do we avoid conflict because we don't want people to disapprove of us? Do we avoid conflict because we don't like discomfort?

*Engage in specific and intelligent spiritual warfare.* When we see what we typically live for and how we try to get it, we can start to grow in repentance and faith. We want to be brutally honest about our sin, but we also want to be ardently hopeful about what Christ has done for us on the cross. We want to remember that because we have the Holy Spirit, we already have the resources available to fight against ungodly conflict.

*Consider the other person.* 1 Thessalonians 5:14-18 gives us some critical guidance here:

> And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all. See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *What different actions does Paul say we should take when considering the other person? (Warn, encourage, help)*

**DISCUSSION QUESTION:** *What does Paul say we should always do when we consider another person? (Be patient, kind, thankful, joyful, and not vengeful)*

As our hearts are reclaimed by the grace of God, as individuals we should ask questions about what it will look like to engage in godly conflict. Do I need to pursue someone and confront him? Do I need to be patient and encourage him? Do I need to overlook an offense? What sins and weaknesses in the other person do I need to consider? Paul says there are different ways to confront, based on what the person needs and what will build him up.

*Make a plan to approach the person.* If we think patience has run its course and we need to address an issue, approach the person in this way:

- Own whatever personal sin we have brought to the situation. Only do this if you have sin to own - sometimes you will; sometimes you won't. Most of the time we do bring sin into the situation, so don't be afraid to admit where you have not loved well, even if your sin was your response to the other's sin. Our confidence in Christ's righteousness (and not our own) is the only thing that will enable us to do this!
- Agree together that we want God's will. This can take the focus off ourselves and remind us that God wants to use the conflict for our growth. It also gives us both the same focus moving forward.
- Name the problem. We may need to address more than one problem. Be specific so that we are both dealing with the same problem. Deal with one problem at a time!
- Explore possible solutions. Stay focused on the problem, and come with a desire to deal with it. Suggest possible alternative solutions, and choose one to implement.
- Implement the agreed upon solution. Be specific and determine what it will look like.
- Evaluate our implementation. Make a commitment to get together again and evaluate how the solution is working. Such a commitment is a form of accountability. It communicates a deep commitment to the relationship.

No one ever said that conflict would be fun, but the Christian life is not always fun. That is not the most important thing to God. He is committed to something much bigger. His kingdom plan involves a total restoration of what he has made. He will settle for nothing less in his creation than to see that all things ultimately bring him glory. He will be at the center of everything at the end of the age, and when that happens, we will be most satisfied. Right now, he is using conflict to work out this comprehensive plan in us. Take heart, for he is present in our struggles and he is fighting on our behalf!

C.S. Lewis wrote:

> ... we must not be surprised if we are in for a rough time. When a man turns to Christ and seems to be getting on pretty well (in the sense that some of his habits are not corrected), he often feels that it would now be natural if things went fairly smoothly.When troubles come along—illnesses, money troubles, new kinds of temptation—he is disappointed. These things, he feels, might have been necessary to rouse him and make him repent in his bad old days; but why now? Because God is forcing him on, or up, to a higher level: putting him into situations where he will have to be very much braver, or more patient, or more loving, than he ever dreamed of being before. It seems to us all unnecessary: but that is because we have not yet had the slightest notion of the tremendous thing He means to make of us.

> I find I must borrow yet another parable from George MacDonald. Imagine yourself as a living house. God comes in to rebuild that house. At first, perhaps, you can understand what He is doing. He is getting the drains right and stopping the leaks in the roof and so on: you knew that those jobs needed doing and so you are not surprised. But presently He starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts abominably and does not seem to make sense. What on earth is He up to? The explanation is that He is building quite a different house from the one you thought of—throwing out a new wing here, putting on an extra floor there, running up towers, making courtyards. You thought you were going to be made into a decent little cottage: but He is building a palace. He intends to come and live in it Himself.
